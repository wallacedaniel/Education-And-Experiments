  First name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">

Last name: <input type="text" name="lname" form="form1">

Send form-data that is default encoded (the first submit button), and encoded as "multipart/form-data" (the second submit button):

<form action="/action_page_binary.asp" method="post">
  First name: <input type="text" name="fname"><br>

The Action Attribute
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.

Normally, the form data is sent to a web page on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

In the example above, the form data is sent to a page on the server called "/action_page.php". This page contains a server-side script that handles the form data:

If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

The Method Attribute
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data:

When to Use GET?
The default method when submitting form data is GET.

However, when GET is used, the submitted form data will be visible in the page address field:

Note: GET must NOT be used when sending sensitive information! GET is best suited for short, non-sensitive, amounts of data, because it has size limitations too.


When to Use POST?
Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information. The POST method does not display the submitted form data in the page address field.

POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.

The Name Attribute
Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.

If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.


Attribute	Description
accept-charset	Specifies the charset used in the submitted form (default: the page charset).
action	Specifies an address (url) where to submit the form (default: the submitting page).
autocomplete	Specifies if the browser should autocomplete the form (default: on).
enctype	Specifies the encoding of the submitted data (default: is url-encoded).
method	Specifies the HTTP method used when submitting the form (default: GET).
name	Specifies a name used to identify the form (for DOM usage: document.forms.name).
novalidate	Specifies that the browser should not validate the form.
target	Specifies the target of the address in the action attribute (default: _self).








The most important form element is the <input> element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

All the different input types are covered in the next chapter.

The <select> Element
The <select> element defines a drop-down list:

The <option> elements defines an option that can be selected.

By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.

To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option:







The rows attribute specifies the visible number of lines in a text area.

The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area.



Input Type Submit
defines a button for submitting form data to a form-handler.

The form-handler is typically a server page with a script for processing input data.

The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute:









HTML5 <datalist> Element
The <datalist> element specifies a list of pre-defined options for an <input> element.

Users will see a drop-down list of the pre-defined options as they input data.

The list attribute of the <input> element, must refer to the id attribute of the <datalist> element.






HTML5 <keygen> Element
The purpose of the <keygen> element is to provide a secure way to authenticate users.

The <keygen> element specifies a key-pair generator field in a form.

When the form is submitted, two keys are generated, one private and one public.

The private key is stored locally, and the public key is sent to the server.

The public key could be used to generate a client certificate to authenticate the user in the future.






The <output> element represents the result of a calculation (like one performed by a script).









If you change the input values and then click the "Reset" button, the form-data will be reset to the default values.





Depending on browser support, a color picker can show up in the input field.

  Select your favorite color:
  


Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

  Birthday:
  



You can also add restrictions to dates:

  Enter a date before 1980-01-01:

  Enter a date after 2000-01-01:
  


specifies a date and time input field, with no time zone.

Depending on browser support, a date picker can show up in the input field.

  Birthday (date and time):
  

  E-mail:
  
Depending on browser support, the e-mail address can be automatically validated when submitted.


  Birthday (month and year):

  Quantity:
  



The  defines a control for entering a number whose exact value is not important (like a slider control). Default range is 0 to 100. However, you can set restrictions on what numbers are accepted with the min, max, and step attributes:



  Search Google:
  

a search field behaves like a regular text field).


  Select a time:
  

Depending on browser support, a time picker can show up in the input field.



The  is used for input fields that should contain a URL address.

Depending on browser support, the url field can be automatically validated when submitted.

Some smartphones recognize the url type, and adds ".com" to the keyboard to match url input.

  Add your homepage:


Select a week:
	


  
  
The value attribute specifies the initial value for an input field:

readonly
The readonly Attribute
