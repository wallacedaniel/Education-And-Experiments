Images from previous web development work.

Sample pages from Wordpress websites with WooCommerce created for ZD Design. As an informal internship through Patchworks Media, I aided in the development of several small business Wordpress sites. Focused on HTML, CSS, PHP editing, and Wordpress/ Woocommerce development. Design is matched from provided Photoshop comps. Also included are images from a personal craft business site BeJubilant.com.
