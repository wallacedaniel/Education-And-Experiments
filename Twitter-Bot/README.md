Twitter bot experiment with Node and Processing JS

Using Node JS to connect to the Twitter API.

daniel_bot.js runs Processing JS script to generate a randomly evolving series of colorful images, then posts them to Twitter.  Also replies to users who follow and mention.

*note to fix* daniel_bot's call to open and run JS not actually generating needed images. Processing must be run manually.

Next Step after fixing connection..play! Experiment with image generation and deploy.

DanielBot is not deployed but you can see the results of my first experiments here:
